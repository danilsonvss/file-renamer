# File Renamer

This PHP script allows you to rename files in a directory by adding a prefix to their names.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have PHP installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the PHP script is located using the `cd` command. For example, if the script is saved in the `Downloads` folder:

   ```shell
   cd Downloads

4. ```shell
    php rename_files.php <directory> <prefix>
